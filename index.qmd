------------------ governing idea

The tidymodels has proved itself useful to do many machine learning tasks

We are now taking the step into clustering

introducing tidyclust (EARLY edition)

The main thesis behind tidymodels is the modular and extensensible framework, where you learn a few verbs and functions and everything transfers natually once you want to try something else

tidyclust provides an extension to that filosphopy

------------------ WHY???!!

Why another package?
parsnip/workflows/tune were build with supervised learning models in mind
were hard to extend to unsupervised learning without ripping up all the code

show side-by-side of where tidyclust and tidymodels differs

------------------ support 1

Fitting a clustering model

+

prediction + cluster assignment + clusters

------------------ support 2

Performance metrics

------------------ support 3

tuning

------------------ Call to action

Please use the package, give us feedback, feature requests
