## introducing tidyclust (**early** edition)

<!--
------------------ WHY???!!
-->

## Why another package?

parsnip + workflows + tune were build with supervised learning models in mind

## Why another package?

show side-by-side of where tidyclust and tidymodels differs

## Why another package?

Code is happening in tidyclust, should be as seamless as possible

<!--
------------------ support 1
-->

## Date data

## Fitting a clustering model

## prediction + cluster assignment + clusters

<!--
------------------ support 2
-->

## Performance metrics

<!--
------------------ support 3
-->

## tuning

<!--
------------------ Call to action
-->
